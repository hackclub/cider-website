**Name**: Hobit App

**Description**: Introducing a personal habit tracker app designed to help you stay on top of your habits without cluttering your calendar. I often forget to do things on time, and adding reminders to my calendar just made it harder to see my schedule. That's why I created this "hobit" (app) â€” to help people like me remember the small habits we don't want to miss. It lets you set daily, weekly, and monthly goals, track your progress, and get timely reminders to keep you on track. The main feature is sending notifications right when you need them (currently on hold due to the lack of a push API key).

**How did you build this**: This was my first app using React Native. I started by learning the basics of React Native and using Expo to make development easier. I focused on creating a simple and user-friendly interface where users can set and track their daily, weekly, and monthly goals. I used state management to handle user inputs and track progress. For notifications, I planned to use push notifications, but it's currently on hold due to the lack of a push API key. Overall, it was a great learning experience and helped me understand mobile app development better.
