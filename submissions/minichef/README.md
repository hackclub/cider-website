# minichef App Submission

**Name**: minichef

**Description**: minichef is a simple yet feature-rich recipe management app. The primary problem I faced was that I needed to save recipes and go through them later on easily, but didn't find a solution to my liking. I needed to be able to add recipes from any URL, even if the app didn't "natively support it", so I made my own app that can do this. Now, I can import any recipe I find online and save it, while also making my own recipes by hand.

**How did you build this**: Since I don't have a mac, I used React Native for the app. I started off from a previous app I made using RN, but eventually ended up changing almost all of the UI in order to make it less clunky. A lot of documentation and stack overflow links finally led me to the final product I'll be publishing.

**How many hours did you spend on this**: 20+ hours

**Did you use #arcade to log your progress?**: Partially- only 8 and a half hours have been logged, even though the project took longer.
