# Pensieve

**Name**: Pensieve

**Description**: Pensieve is a reminder/braindump tool. There have been too many instances when I have a really cool idea or something I need to remember, but taking something out and writing it down neatly would be impractical at the moment. I created Pensieve to utilize AI to solve that problem. You open the app to a giant microphone icon that will use OpenAI Whisper to transcribe your idea, then use GPT-4o to formalize it into an actual reminder.
