Create a new directory in this folder with the name of your app. Inside the directory, create a markdown file with the name README.md and include the following details:

Name: Valease

Description: Valease is an all-in-one travel planning app. You can search for places and flights and add them to your itinerary that you made in the app. You can also make packing lists, and the app will remind you to pack the item before your trip starts. You can add your own events. The events can be carried over across devices as they are synced to Firebase.

How did you build this: I used Swift UI to build the app. I learned Swift and SwiftUI in computer science class, and the basic functionality of the app was a project for that class. I used cocoapods for Firebase because my school blocked the swift package manager.
